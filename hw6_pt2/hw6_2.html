<h2 style="color:rgb(59, 137, 202); text-decoration:underline">Percentage of Wisconsinites Per County Over 25 Years Old With a Bachelor's Degree or Higher</h2>
<p>These maps represent the ratio of people per county in Wisconsin who are over 25 years old and have a bachelor degree or higher.
    The percentage is measured by dividing the number of people in a county over 25 with bachelor degrees or higher by the total population in that county over 25.
    I used this ratio because it best represents where concentrations of people with higher education are located.
    I used adults over 25 because the younger data set, 18-24, includes adults who may still be in college and have not yet achieved their degree. 
    Furthermore, I wanted to focus on the population set that is likely already in the workforce. 
    By dividing this number by the total population, you can determine some patterns of education level in relation to location, such as proximity to urban areas.

<p>Equal Count as a classification scheme works well when data are spread out evenly in a data set. It's thus great at highlighting how data values--specifically percentiles--vary along a region. 
    However, if the data are not evenly spread out, some classes can contain very different values and not be properly represented.

<p>The Equal Interval classification method breaks up the data into equally-sized classes and is best for continuous data sets. It creates easily readable and understandable legends for nontechnical audiences. 
    A drawback is that most of the data often ends up in a small number of classes, so it is difficult to understand variety within classes.

<p>The Natural Breaks or Jenks classification is best for unevenly distributed data that doesn't skew toward an end of the data range. It can result in a more visually comprehensible map, showing more data variation. 
    A downside is that the number ranges in each class can vary widely, which can lead to misinterpretation of the map. Also, because the ranges are specific to each data set when using natural breaks, it's difficult to compare maps that use it.
