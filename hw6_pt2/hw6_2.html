<h2 style="color:rgb(59, 137, 202); text-decoration:underline">Percentage of Wisconsinites Per County Over 25 Years Old With a Bachelor's Degree or Higher</h2>
<p>These maps represent the ratio of people per county in Wisconsin who are over 25 years old and have a bachelor degree or higher.
    The percentage is measured by dividing the number of people in a county over 25 with degrees by the total population in that county over 25.
    I used this ratio because it best represents where concentrations of people with higher education are located.
    I used adults over 25 because the younger data set, 18-24, includes adults who may still be in college and have not yet achieved their degree. 
    Furthermore, I wanted to focus on the population set that is likely already in the workforce. 
    By dividing this number by the total population, you can determine some patterns of education level in relation to location or proximity to urban areas.
